               <h4 class="title">Soil preparation:-</h4>
               <p>Ploughing is the process of loosening and turning the soil. Its also known as tilling. Ploughing of soil is important for the following reasons:
               It allows roots of the plants to penetrate deeply into the soil. This firmly roots the plant.
               Loose soil also provides better aeration to the roots allowing them to breathe easily.
               Ploughing also removes weeds and other waste materials from the field.
               It brings nutrient-rich soil to the top, which helps in the growth of plants.
</p><br><br>
<h4 class="title">Sowing:-</h4>
<p>Sowing seeds is essentially the most important part of crop production. It is necessary to focus on even the smallest details. The following precautions should be taken when sowing seeds:
Seeds must be planted at the correct distance or intervals from each other. This is to ensure that all plants get their fair share of light, water and nutrients for growth and development. Planting seeds at equidistance have been proved to increase the yield of the farm.
Seeds must be sown at the correct depth in the soil. If seeds are simply scattered on the top they are likely to be blown away or eaten by animals or birds. If we sow them too deep into the ground, they will not germinate due to lack of air.
The seeds that you sow should be of the highest quality. They have to germ and disease free.

<h4 class="title">Irrigation:-</h4>
<p>Only 18% of Maharashtra's cultivated area is irrigated. The most suitable irrigation methods are:-
    <p><u>Drip irrigation:-</u> Drip irrigation is a type of micro-irrigation system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface.
        <p><u>Sprinkle irrigation:-</u> Sprinkler irrigation is a method of applying irrigation water which is similar to natural rainfall. Water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping. It is then sprayed into the air through sprinklers so that it breaks up into small water drops which fall to the ground.
        </p></p></p><br><br>
        <h4 class="title">Harvesting:-</h4>
        <p>There are various factors to consider before the harvesting of crops. The crops need close examination to ensure that harvesting is not premature. This leads to shedding of seeds and loss of crop. And if the crops are overripened, they lose their value in the market or may even be unconsumable.

Harvesting in India is generally done manually. Sicles is a tool that is used to cut the crop. This method is a laborious and time-consuming and only suitable for small-sized farms. On larger farms, a harvester is used which combines harvesting with threshing and winnowing.</p>
